        ABOUT EASYGUI
        =============
        
        EasyGui provides an easy-to-use interface for simple GUI interaction
        with a user.  It does not require the programmer to know anything about
        tkinter, frames, widgets, callbacks or lambda.  All GUI interactions are
        invoked by simple function calls that return results.
        
        Example Usage
        -------------
        
            >>> import easygui
            >>> easygui.ynbox('Shall I continue?', 'Title', ('Yes', 'No'))
            1
            >>> easygui.msgbox('This is a basic message box.', 'Title Goes Here')
            'OK'
            >>> easygui.buttonbox('Click on your favorite flavor.', 'Favorite Flavor', ('Chocolate', 'Vanilla', 'Strawberry'))
            'Chocolate'
